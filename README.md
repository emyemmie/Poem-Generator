# Poem-Generator
Poem generator for MIT Makers Portfolio

Hi! I've never used GitHub before, so forgive me if it's all a bit messy.

The most important modules are probably Author.py and Poem.py, which writes and is the poem, respectively.
I'm sorry if it's a bit difficult to decode (pun intended), as I never really thought anyone else would be seeing it.
I will clean it up when I update it.

Thanks for reading and have a good day!
